      <h2>The Problem</h2> 
      <p>
        I've spent years interviewing Software Engineers of all different levels. 
        But, even though I don't lack experience, it never seemed to get easier.
        I struggled to compare candidates to each other.
        I never felt that I had a clear "signal" that a candidate was right for the role.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, then I discovered an incredibly simple way to simplify the decision making process and reduce bias.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        First, a hiring manager opens a role. They create five "yes" or "no" questions that interviewers will use
        to evaluate every candidate for the position. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For each candidate, the interviewer receives a feedback request. After the interview, they select "yes" or "no" for the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an additional question, asking if the interviewer recommends the candidate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The hiring manager will receive a summary of each submitted feedback. 
      </p>
      <h2>Why you should care</h2>
      <p>
        Have you been struggling to compare candidates against each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you ever feel like you're not getting a good "signal" on your candidates, but you're not quite sure what's missing? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying this incredibly simple tool to my interview process has drastically simplified my interview process.
        It saves me time as an interviewer and it makes decisions easier for my hiring managers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I hope you'll scroll back up, log in, and give it a try.
