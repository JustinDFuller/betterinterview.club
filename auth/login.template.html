      <h2>The Problem</h2> 
      <p>
        Let's be honest: 
        we're all biased and judgemental in our own way, even when we try hard not to be. 
        It's an unfortunate quirk of humankind. 
        It's particularly unfortunate when we try to evaluate others objectively
        because all sorts of unwanted bias sneaks in to our judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is problematic for those of us who conduct interviews.
        We want to hire the best candidates as quickly as possible.
        But, unnoticed by our conscious selves, we judge candidates based
        on their name, gender, race, age, accent, clothing style, zoom background, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a pretty fun product pitch, isn't it? 
      </p>
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, we've known the solution for a long time.
        Countless people and organizations have discovered it over and over again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To objectively assess a situation, we must ask consistent, unambiguous questions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We must apply these same questions repeatedly, and they must be phrased with little room for subjective judgement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Better Interviews does exactly that. It provides a framework that provides hiring managers and interviewers
        the tools they need to objectively asses candidates.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        It's pretty simple. 
      </p>
      <p>
        First, a hiring manager opens a role. They create five "yes" or "no" questions that interviewers will use
        to evaluate every candidate for the position. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, an interviewer receives a feedback request. After the interview, they select "yes" or "no" for each question.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an additional question, asking if the interviewer recommends the candidate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The hiring manager will receive a summary of each submitted feedback. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, that's it. It's so simple, but I believe it will drastically improve your hiring experience. 
      </p>
      <h2>Why you should care</h2>
      <p>
        Have you been struggling to compare candidates against each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you ever feel like you're not getting a good "signal" on your candidates, but you're not quite sure what's missing? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying this incredibly simple tool to your interview process will simplify your debriefs and assessments.
       It will save your interviewers time. It will make decisions easier for hiring managers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I hope you'll scroll back up, log in, and give it a try. I don't think you'll regret it.
