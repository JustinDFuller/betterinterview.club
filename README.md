Let's make it easy to manage interviews.

## Workflow

1. I create a new organization for my company by signing up with `justin@betterinterviews.com`.
1. I invite the first hiring manager: `max@betterinterviews.com`.
1. Max receives a registration link in her email. Clicking it brings her to the organization overview page.
1. Max is hiring for a `Staff Software Engineer` role at our company. She clicks `Open a new role`.
1. She picks 5 `yes` or `no` questions that she wants her interviewers to answer after interviewing the candidate.
1. She types in the emmails of the two interviewers to request their feedback: `kit@betterinterviews.com` and `thea@betterinterviews.com`.
1. Kit and Thea receive an email requesting their feedback. Clicking the link brings them to the `Give Feedback` page.
1. On the `Give Feedback` page, they simply select `Yes` or `No` for each question.
1. After feedback is received, Max, the person who opened the role, receives an email linking her to the `Feedback Given` page, where she can see the feedback.
1. Once feedback is complete, Max closes the role.

## TODO

* Send email after invite.
* Send email to request feedback.
* Log in from home page.
* Log out.
* Send email to creator after feedback received.
* Close a role once feedback is complete.
